# Preference Store — how the team evolves

The team is **project-agnostic**: the same agents start from the same frozen definitions in every repo. Left alone, a preference the user expresses in one project — a liked UI pattern, a code convention they approved, a workflow they always want — dies with that session. Nothing carries it into the next project.

This file documents the loop that fixes that: **capture → sweep → evolve**. It is the preference-store sibling of `TRACKER.md` (the plan store). The distinction:

- **`TRACKER.md` / `TODOS.md` / `issues/` / `notes/`** — *project-specific* todos, known defects, brainstorming, and the current change's brief. They live at user level too, but **keyed per project** (`~/.claude/kru/management/<project-slug>/`), because they're about *that product*.
- **This store** — *cross-project* preferences about how **the team itself** should work. They live **un-keyed at the kru root**, because they belong to the team, not any product.

## The loop

```
any project (cwd = someone's repo)         ~/.claude/kru/
  /kru:remember  ───────────────▶  inbox.md   ◀─── agents append learnings
                                              │            (end-of-run, via lead handoff)
                                              │        ◀─── dispatch-auditor files process
                                              │            deviations (hook-fired at turn end)
                                              │        ◀─── /setup files what a repo knows
                                              │            that a plugin skill lacks
                                     /kru:roster learn
                                              │  (run from the plugin source repo; user gates each edit)
                                              ▼
                              the plugin, versioned + shared
                                agents/<seat>.md              (targeted prompt edits)
                                skills/<owner>/SKILL.md       (incl. lead — orchestration-wide rules)
                                → commit + tag  (minor bump)
                                              │
                                     /kru:setup      (typed in a repo)
                                              ▼
                              that repo's .claude/CLAUDE.md
                                this engagement's answers, in that file's voice,
                                stamped with the plugin version they came from
```

Three arrows, one circuit. **Cheap lossless capture**, then a **curated, human-gated sweep** that edits the team (mirroring the `TODOS.md` → `/kru:brief` promotion the team already runs), then the **return leg**: a repo picks the evolved practice back up by re-running `/kru:setup`, which re-derives its answers against the newer plugin.

**The plugin holds the practice; a repo's own file holds the engagement.** That split is what the sweep routes on — a preference that would still be true in the next repo goes upstream into a seat or a skill, one true only where it surfaced goes into that repo's sheet (`skills/roster/learn.md` → step 2). The plugin is the same in every engagement, which is exactly why nothing client-specific may land in it.

## Tier 1 — capture (the inbox)

**Location: `~/.claude/kru/inbox.md`** — a single user-global file, created on first capture. Not per-project (the team is project-agnostic, so captures don't belong in any per-project plan store), and **not** the plugin's install dir (that resolves to a read-only, version-pinned cache when installed from the marketplace — unwritable from other projects and blown away on update). Home dir is the one place writable from every project and durable across plugin updates.

It has **three writers**:

1. **The user, explicitly** — `/kru:remember <what they liked>`. Never inferred from approval; the team does not guess. A liked *pattern* with concrete code is saved as an artifact under `~/.claude/kru/patterns/<slug>.md` and indexed by an inbox line.
2. **Agents, as they work** — a builder/reviewer that discovers a durable preference (the user rejected X twice and chose Y; this repo's approved convention is Z) appends one line at end-of-run. This is journaling a *learning*, not reading approval — the same instinct as `test-writer` capturing a repo's testing conventions. The **lead** hands each dispatched seat the inbox path + this format so the learning lands (Step 3).
3. **`dispatch-auditor`, on the team's own process** — the plugin's hooks log every team-seat dispatch to a session ledger (`~/.claude/kru/audit/`), and a Stop-hook nudge fires the seat to audit it against the `lead` Step 3 contract, filing `[workflow]` lines for durable deviations (routing misses, incomplete handoffs, restated ambient blocks). This is the loop's autonomous half — the team observes how it was run and proposes its own corrections — and it is autonomy at the **capture** tier only: still never inferred from approval (the ledger holds the lead's dispatch text, not the user's reactions), and still gated at the sweep like every other line. The handoff gate's refusals land in that ledger too, and in `~/.claude/kru/refusals.jsonl` across sessions, which the sweep reads beside the inbox for gate misfires (`skills/roster/learn.md`).

Entry format — one line, untriaged, lossless (mirrors the `TODOS.md` line):

```markdown
- [design] prefers bento-grid hero over centered-stack — _user · acme-site · 2026-07-21_
- [code] approved Result<T,E> returns over throwing at call boundaries — _agent:sveltekit-builder · acme-site · 2026-07-21_
- [workflow] wants the plan grilled before any build, always — _user · acme-site · 2026-07-21_
- [design] liked this pricing table → patterns/pricing-3col.md — _user · acme-site · 2026-07-21_
```

- **lane tag** `[design|code|workflow]` — routes the sweep to the right destination.
- **source** `user`, `agent:<seat-slug>`, or `setup` — who captured it (`setup` files a recipe a repo holds that a plugin skill lacks, found while deriving its sheet).
- **project** the repo slug it surfaced in, then the date captured. The slug is the **promotion bar**, not just context: the sweep collapses a group to its distinct slugs, and one slug reads as that client where two or more read as the team (`skills/roster/learn.md` → step 1).
- Optional `→ patterns/<slug>.md` when a concrete artifact backs it.

Capture never derails the task — park the line, keep working (`TODOS.md` discipline).

## Tier 2 — sweep (`/roster learn`)

The **curated, human-gated** half — it edits the team, so it lives under roster-ops (`/kru:roster learn`), reusing the same version/wiring machinery as `hire`/`author`. Run it **from the plugin source repo** periodically (not from a product repo — it commits the plugin). It:

1. Reads `~/.claude/kru/inbox.md` (+ `patterns/`); groups by lane, dedupes, drops noise.
2. For each keeper, picks a **destination**:
   - **seat-specific** (a default only `graphic-designer`, or only the Svelte builder, should carry) → a **targeted prompt edit** to that `agents/<seat>.md`.
   - **cross-seat** (several seats should carry it) → the same targeted edit in each affected seat, or the owning skill (`lead` SKILL.md for orchestration-wide rules).
   - **reusable concrete pattern** → keep the `patterns/<slug>.md` artifact, reference it from the seat/skill that uses it.
3. **Proposes the diffs to the user and gates on approval** — editing agent prompts has global blast radius, so nothing lands unreviewed (same as `hire`'s hand-off).
4. Applies approved edits; **drains** the promoted lines from the inbox (leaves un-promoted lines for next time), archiving artifacts it kept.
5. Version-bumps (minor for new prefs/capability, patch for a tiny tweak), runs `audit`, hands off. Commit/tag left to the user (git rule).

## The destination — a consulted corpus, or the seat itself

There is deliberately **no central style file**. Claude Code plugins cannot ship auto-loaded context (no plugin CLAUDE.md/rules mechanism), so a file that has to be *handed down* only reaches a seat if the lead remembers to re-read and re-slice it on every dispatch — a hop that silently drops. A preference therefore lands in one of two places, both of which the seat reaches on its own:

- **`ui-patterns`** (`skills/ui-patterns/`) for a component-level UI default — the corpus a builder **consults by build target**, loading the one group matching what it's about to write. This is where most `[design]`-lane preferences go. It's a skill the seat loads itself rather than context the lead carries, which is what makes it survive the dispatch hop the retired central style file never did; and it holds the bound a flat list of preferences can't — `CURATION.md` requires every entry to name **the default it corrects**, so the corpus grows with wrong defaults rather than with taste. It takes **behavior only**: validation timing, where focus goes, where an outcome reports, what a control announces. A preference about how something *looks* — rank, ink, borders, the focus indicator itself — is the project design system's to settle, so the sweep returns it to you instead of filing it.
- **The seat's own `agents/<seat>.md` prompt**, or the owning skill (`lead`'s SKILL.md for orchestration-wide rules), for everything that isn't a component pattern — a stack-specific mechanism, a routing rule, a seat's posture. Where a rule has both, the rule goes in the corpus and only the mechanism goes in the seat.

Versioned and shared either way — every install inherits them; the raw inbox stays personal to the user's machine.

The team starts frozen and earns its defaults one swept preference at a time — in place.
