# sourced, never run: the read-only test every bash gate shares. a session edits
# through bash as readily as through Edit or Write — sed -i, a heredoc, git
# apply — so a gate on writes has to gate bash too, and a command that only
# *reads* passes. every verb has to read, or the command counts as a write;
# anything unparsed counts as one, because a miss is a silent write and a false
# refusal costs one message.
