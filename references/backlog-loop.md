# Backlog loop — the shared mechanics

`/kru:issues-loop` and `/kru:todos-loop` run one loop over two artifacts. Each skill owns its artifact's half — what reconciles, what is **eligible**, what an outcome is called, what the branch is named. This file owns the loop: the branch, the **cap**, one entry per pass, the report.

Typing either command is the user's pick, made in advance, for every eligible entry. A **product call** or a **one-way door** — both defined in `lead` → *Talk to a PM, not to an engineer* — is still the user's, so it is **held** for the end of the run and the run never stops to ask. The cap is `$ARGUMENTS` as a number, else `80`: the count of files changed against the default branch's merge-base never passes it at a commit, so the branch the run leaves stays reviewable.

## 1. Set up — branch and baseline

On the default branch → cut the branch the skill names. A dirty tree → stop and say so in one line: a tree already holding someone's edits has no clean baseline to count from.

The count is `git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD origin/<default>) | wc -l` — the working tree against the merge-base, so an uncommitted change counts before it lands. Read it once now; at or over the cap → report the count and stop.

## 2. Queue — once

Run the skill's reconcile and score sections over the whole artifact, then its bookkeeping writes, committed as one bookkeeping change if they touched the repo. Rank by its rank. The skill's batch and gate message are replaced by this loop.

Read each eligible entry's change against the held bar before it enters the queue: one that has to choose what the product does, says or charges is **held**, recorded with the question in outcome words; one needing a migration, a deletion of user data or anything outward-facing is **held** the same way. Load `incentives` for the weigh.

## 3. Loop — one entry per pass, serialized

Take the top queued entry and:

1. **Fit.** Estimate the files the change touches, its tests included. Count + estimate over the cap → skip to the next entry; none fits → exit.
2. **Build.** `lead` Step 3 routing and Step 4 review, one builder at a time. The outcome is one of the skill's, or a product call surfacing mid-build → **held**, the builder's work discarded with `git checkout -- <its paths>`.
3. **Measure, then land.** Re-read the count with the change still uncommitted. Within the cap → commit it with its tests and its entry's deletion (`lead` Step 4.5), paths staged by name. Over the cap → leave it uncommitted, record it as *uncommitted*, and exit.
4. **Say it.** One status line: what's different for users, and the count against the cap.

**Exit when** the count reaches the cap, no queued entry fits, or the queue is empty. A pass that lands nothing still removes its entry from the queue, so the loop always terminates.

## 4. Report

One message, `lead`'s *report when work lands* shape:

```
Done on <branch> — 31 of 80 files changed:
  - <what's different for users>
  - <what's different for users>
Plus 3 cleared as already done, 2 bigger than they looked, 9 not reached.

Need your call:
  1. <the product question, in outcomes> — <your recommendation>
  2. ...
```

Held entries get the numbered list, each with a recommendation; everything else is the counted clause. An *uncommitted* change is named in one line with the count it would have reached. Nothing is pushed — the branch is the user's to review and open.

**Completion criterion: every queued entry has a named outcome — one of the skill's, held, uncommitted, or not reached — and the count at the last commit is at or under the cap.**
