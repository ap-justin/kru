description: Audit the comments in a target — working tree, path, branch or PR — and fix them in place.

Comments are the deliverable and the only thing that moves. The house standard, in one line: **a comment carries what the code can't, in the voice of the comments around it, written for the next person to read the code and never for the person who asked for the change.** An agent-written diff drifts off that standard in two directions at once — it adds notes addressed to the prompter, and it drops the notes that were already there.

**Every hunk in the resulting diff is a comment line.** No code moves, nothing reformats, no imports churn. That's the completion criterion, and it's checkable: read `git diff` at the end, and revert anything else the pass or a formatter touched.

## Do

1. **Resolve the target** from `$ARGUMENTS`:

   | argument | scope |
   | --- | --- |
   | *(none)* | the working tree — `git diff HEAD`, plus untracked files |
   | a path or glob | those files, whole |
   | a branch name | `git diff <base>...<branch>` — three dots, the branch's own work, not what the base did meanwhile |
   | a number | a PR: `gh pr checkout <n>` first (fixing needs a working tree), then its three-dot diff |

   **A diff target audits what the change wrote, not every comment in the files it grazed.** Restyling a file's existing comments because a two-line diff passed through buries the change under noise nobody asked for. A path target is the one that means whole files — because the user named them.
2. **Read the hunks.** Comments are found by reading, not by pattern: a grep for `//` hits every URL in the file, `#` hits every fragment and every shell string, and `/*` hits a regex literal. `git diff -U0` narrows a large target to the changed lines.
3. **Cut what the file shouldn't be carrying.** Each is a class, not a phrasing:
   - **Narration** — *added error handling*, *changed from X to Y*, *as requested*, *NEW:*, *this fixes the bug*, and the weighing of alternatives no fact forces (*a throw here beats a cast because…*). A note addressed to whoever asked. The one fact that rules the obvious alternative out is not narration — step 4 keeps it. The commit is where the change is explained; the file has no memory of the request.
   - **Restatement** — the comment says what the line says (`// increment the counter`), what the type checker already enforces (*must match the sdk* on a literal typed to one value), or what `package.json` / the lockfile already records (a dependency version). Pays a line, adds nothing, and goes stale the moment the line changes. Density otherwise follows the file — step 4 keeps a teaching file's register.
   - **Archeology** — *previously we used X*, a compat note naming something no longer in the repo, or a transition date (*became X at 2024-04-10*) the code is past — say what the default *is*.
   - **Elsewhere** — the comment describes state that lives in another file, a dashboard, or a setting (*the webhook endpoint pins api_version …* in the client). Written for a reader who isn't in this file, stale when that other thing moves. Move it to where that reader is, or to the plan store. A constraint from elsewhere that *this* line must obey is not this class — step 4 keeps it.
   - **Commented-out code** — delete it. git has it.
   - **Position markers** — a section banner (`// ---- helpers ----`) or a closing-brace tag (`} // end try`) marks structure a named extraction should carry. Cut the reflexive ones; a banner survives only where the grouping is real and the file already leans on the convention. The extraction the marker implies is code and out of scope — name it in the report instead.
   - **Stale** — the comment describes behavior the code no longer has. Rewrite it to the truth, or cut it. A wrong comment outranks the code in the reader's head, which is why it's the worst line in the file. A comment imprecise from its first commit (*returns when closed* on a method that really waits a timeout and throws) is stale one commit early — exact, or absent.
4. **Keep, always:**
   - **Anything answering *why*** — the constraint, the ordering that matters, the bug a workaround exists for, the value chosen after the obvious one failed. Two shapes of it read like cut classes and aren't: the one fact that rules out a correct-looking alternative (`throw, not cast: sdk returns null on rate-limit` — tighten a paragraph of weighing down to it, don't cut it), and an outside constraint this line must obey that names where it lives (`≤ queue visibility timeout in wrangler.jsonc`). Chatty-and-load-bearing beats terse-and-gone: when a *why* comment reads badly, tighten the wording and leave the fact. When the *why* explains a surprise in our own code rather than a vendor, platform or protocol, name its symbol in the report as a **reshape** candidate: the rename, type or extraction that would make the comment unnecessary.
   - **Directives** — `eslint-disable-next-line`, `@ts-expect-error`, `biome-ignore`, `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `@vite-ignore`, `prettier-ignore`, shebangs, license headers, `Code generated … DO NOT EDIT` banners. These are API, not prose; recasing or rewording one silently turns a tool off. Look up the rule each suppression silences; one guarding correctness or safety (`no-floating-promises`, a `@ts-expect-error` over a nullable read) names its symbol in the report as a **reshape** candidate too.
   - **Doc comments on an exported surface** — JSDoc/TSDoc/docstrings carry their own conventions (capitalized sentences, `@param`). Correct them for accuracy; leave the case.
   - **A file written to teach** — a tutorial, an example, a template whose annotations mark what a later run replaces. Its comment density is the file's purpose; hold its comments to *exact*, not to the cut list.
   - **Vendored and generated files** — not yours to restyle.
5. **Restore what the change dropped.** The other half of the standard: moving or refactoring code preserves its comments. Read the target's deletions — a comment that vanished while its code moved goes back at the code's new home. A comment left heading code inserted between it and its line is orphaned the same way — move it back down to its line. A comment deleted *with* the code it described is correctly gone.
6. **Bring the prose that's left into the file's voice** — inline explanatory comments only, with step 4's directives and doc comments exempt. Case and grammar follow the comments around it: sentences where the file writes them, lowercase fragments where it has none to match. A comment already in the file's voice is left alone. Edit only what the language's own comment syntax opens: a `//` inside a string, a template literal, or JSX text is not a comment.
7. **Delete the whole construct, not the text inside it.** A JSX comment is `{/* … */}` — dropping the inner half leaves a stray `{}` in the tree. Same for Svelte/HTML `<!-- … -->` and a block comment's closing line.
8. **Report.** A count per group — *cut* · *restored* · *reworded* — and a line for each edit that changes what a reader learns; the per-edit list with `file:line` on request; then the **reshape** candidates from step 4, one line each naming the symbol and the change. Then the diff check from the top of this file, in a line: what moved, and that it was comments only.

## Don't

- Don't touch code, formatting, or naming — a fix that "while I was in there" reflowed a function makes the comment pass unreviewable.
- Don't run the formatter, the linter, or the build afterwards. Nothing here can break them, and their diff hides yours.
