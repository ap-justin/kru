description: "Composition — how a screen's parts relate (grouping by space, hierarchy, alignment, width) and, when values are being chosen, the craft of choosing them (color, type, depth, finish). Load when drafting an artboard or canvas direction, laying out a screen, section or card, or checking one that reads flat or cluttered."

A token file says which gaps, inks and weights exist. It never says which gap goes *between* two things and which goes *inside* one, so a screen built entirely on-system can still read as one undifferentiated stack. This skill carries that half — the **relations** between values — and, for the turns where values are being chosen at all, the craft of choosing them.

Two kinds of file, and the kind decides who loads it:

- **Relations** hold on any token file, so they bind every screen, every seat that composes one, every turn.
- **Values** are craft for choosing a palette, a type set or a shadow — a canvas direction at bootstrap, or a system change the user asked to see. Where a system exists, its token file answers every value question and these files stay closed; a value it lacks is a **named gap**, never one picked from here.

## The index

| About to | Load |
|---|---|
| lay out any screen, section or card — draft a mockup, build one, check one | `reference/layout.md` · `reference/hierarchy.md` · `reference/text.md` |
| place a photo, an icon at a new size, a screenshot, a user upload, text over an image | `reference/media.md` |
| draft canvas directions from nothing — where to start, personality, what to leave undrawn | `reference/directions.md` |
| choose colours: a palette, a ramp, greys, colour on colour | `reference/color.md` |
| choose depth: shadows, raised and inset surfaces, layering | `reference/depth.md` |
| choose type: faces, a scale, line-height, tracking | `reference/text.md` → *Choosing type* |
| add finish to a plain but correct direction | `reference/directions.md` → *Finish* |

## The pass

Run it on every artboard before a canvas publishes, and on every screen or section before a build returns.

1. **Outline the groups before placing anything.** Write the screen as a tree: page → section → group → item → part (a label and its box, a title and its meta, an avatar and its name). Every node is something the reader should perceive as one unit.
2. **Give each depth of the tree its own space tier, strictly larger going outward.** Part-internal < item-internal < between items < between groups < between sections. A tier is a step on the repo's space ladder; two adjacent depths never share a step.
3. **Rank before styling.** Name the one primary action per view and the reading order of the text; `hierarchy.md` spends that rank.
4. **Pick each step by its neighbours.** Guess a step, then try the one either side; two of the three usually look wrong at once. When an outer one wins, re-centre on it and compare again.
5. **Check the draft against every entry in the files the index mapped.**

**Done when** every node in the tree has a gap to its siblings larger than any gap inside it, every view has exactly one primary action, and every entry in the loaded files has been checked against the draft.
