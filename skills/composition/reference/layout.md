# Layout

## The space around a group is larger than the space inside it

**Default it corrects:** one gap for everything — a `gap` or `space-y` on a parent whose children are themselves groups, so the label sits as close to the previous field as to its own box, and the list reads as a flat run of equals.
**Instances that recur:** a section heading equidistant from the section above and the content below (it belongs to what follows, so more space above than below); list items spaced at the text's own line-height, so a wrapped item reads as two; a meta row where the date sits as close to the next card's title as to its own; a button cluster the same distance from the field above as the buttons are from each other; card-internal padding equal to or larger than the gutter between cards. The compact form case is `ui-patterns` → `reference/forms-and-mutations.md`.
**Check:** for each node, measure the smallest gap to a sibling and the largest gap inside it. Sibling gap ≤ internal gap is the defect, horizontal and vertical alike.

## Separate with space first, then a background step, then a border

**Default it corrects:** a border on every card, a divider under every row and an outline on the panel holding them — separation drawn three times, so the lines out-shout the content. Or a background change *and* a border on the same edge, when either alone separates.
**Rule:** more space is the cheapest separator and adds no UI. Next, a background one step apart. Next, a shadow on a surface that already differs from the page. A border comes last.
**Check:** every border on the artboard does a job neither spacing nor a background step already does. Where two separators stack on one edge, cut one.

## A container matches the group it contains

**Default it corrects:** a card drawn around a layout slot rather than a unit of meaning — related items split across two cards, or unrelated ones sharing one because they happened to sit side by side.
**Check:** each surface on the artboard maps to one node of the pass's tree.

## An element takes the width its content needs

**Default it corrects:** a login card at six grid columns, a settings form stretched across a 1400px canvas, a sidebar sized as a percentage that grows on wide screens and cramps on narrow ones.
**Rule:** give a component a `max-width` and let it shrink only once the viewport is narrower than that; fixed-width sidebars sized to their contents, a fluid main area with its own inner layout. A narrow thing that looks lost in a wide layout is split into columns (the supporting text beside the form), never stretched. Each section sizes to its own content, whatever width the nav spans; where a section genuinely needs the room, it takes it.
**Check:** at the widest artboard, no form, card or text block is wider than its content needs, and no element sized in percentages gets *narrower* as the viewport widens past a breakpoint.

## The narrow artboard is drawn first

**Default it corrects:** a wide layout drawn on a 1440 canvas and squeezed afterwards, so every narrow compromise is a patch.
**Rule:** draw the ~400px frame first, then widen it and change only what felt compromised. The wide frame usually needs less change than expected.

## Density is a decision, and roomy is the default

**Default it corrects:** space added only until nothing looks broken, which leaves every gap at the minimum.
**Rule:** start a step roomier than feels right and take space away — what looks generous on one element reads as enough in a full screen. Pack tight only where the job is seeing many things at once (a dashboard, a table), and say so in the artboard notes.
**Check:** a dense artboard names its reason; any other artboard has room to lose a step before it looks cramped.

## Narrow viewports compress large things faster than small ones

**Default it corrects:** a heading-to-body ratio carried unchanged from desktop, so the phone headline is enormous; or padding defined relative to font size, so a small button looks zoomed out rather than small.
**Rule:** sizes scale independently. Display type steps down further than body type does on a narrow frame; a large control gets disproportionately more padding and a small one disproportionately less.
**Check:** the narrow artboard's display sizes step down further than its body size does.

## A fixed length inside a height-capped container is checked at its shortest height

**Default it corrects:** a floor or band authored against a tall region and spent in a short one — a `min-height` on a flex child in a sheet capped at `80svh`, an edge fade whose depth is a fixed token.
**Rule:** state each fixed length against what it must not swallow, and say what happens when the room isn't there. A floor on a flex child beats `flex: 1`, so the column overflows its cap and the child paints outside the clip, under whatever follows it: gate the floor behind a `min-height` query, or let the child shrink. A fade sized as a constant can cover the whole first row past the fold in a short scrollport, so the row reads unreachable while one drag away: size it against the row, narrow it where a media query already admits the cap, and buy room back before dropping the fade — it's the only cue that more lies past the edge.
**Check:** phone landscape and 200% zoom, where the cap is shortest — 200% zoom makes this a reflow failure, not a landscape edge case.
