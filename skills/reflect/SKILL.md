A review gates a slice about to land. **Reflecting looks back at work that already landed** — and then fixes it. The seat that wrote a lane is the one that knows what it got wrong there: the migration's lock, the session cookie's `sameSite`, the webhook's idempotency key, the loader that fetches on every navigation. A generic reviewer reads that code and sees code. The seat reads it against the official source it was built from.

Two phases, and the second is why the first is worth running. **Look back** fans the roster out read-only and comes back with findings. **Then fix it** turns that pile into scoped, sliced, partitioned work and lands it. A findings list nobody sliced is a document; the slices are the deliverable.

What keeps the first phase affordable: **every seat runs in its own context**, so the main thread never carries a subsystem it isn't routing, and **every seat writes its record to disk** and returns a ranked shortlist plus a pointer. Run any other way, a look-back spends its whole budget on record the lead reads once and forwards nowhere.

## Look back

**Read-only, all of it.** Every seat in this phase, builders included, returns findings and moves nothing. That's this phase's completion criterion: when it ends, `git status` is what it was when you started, and every file in the target is assigned to a seat.

1. **Resolve the target** from `$ARGUMENTS`:

   | argument | scope |
   | --- | --- |
   | *(none)* | the working tree — `git diff HEAD`, plus untracked files |
   | a sha | that commit — `git show <sha>` |
   | a branch name | `git diff <base>...<branch>` — three dots, the branch's own work |
   | a number | a PR — `gh pr diff <n>`, and `gh pr view <n>` for what it claimed to do |
   | `everything` | **the code as it stands**, not a diff. Every lane the sheet seats, over its own files, sliced by subsystem |

   The first four look back **on a change**: what it got wrong that is still standing. A diff target is what that change wrote, and the files it merely grazed are `everything`'s scope. `everything` has no diff to anchor it, and is the only scope that needs slicing up front (step 4).

2. **Read the roster off the repo's sheet** — `.claude/CLAUDE.md`'s seat lines (`routes`, `ui`, `data`, `skills`, `project`, and whatever else that repo answered). Those are the seats that built this code, and each line's own citation tells you the stack version the seat should be reading against.

   **No sheet** → the roster is a guess, and a look-back off a guess reads the wrong lanes. Name **`/kru:setup`** for the user in one line; on their say-so to proceed anyway, derive the lanes from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/routing.md` and say in the report that the roster was derived, not read. A **stale** sheet — its stamp below the installed `VERSION`, or a cited line that no longer matches disk — gets the same line, and the run continues off it meanwhile.

3. **Assign every file in the target to a seat**, by the grouping rule at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/lead/SKILL.md` → Step 3, *Group the change's files by seat* — a file's seat owns its stack, not the feature it was named after. Then add the review-only seats the target earns, by `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/lead/references/gates.md`, whose *live-versus-latent* rule is what keeps a batch from being spent on code nothing reaches.

   Every file assigned is checkable: list the target's files, list the assignments, and the two match.

4. **Dispatch in waves, parallel inside a wave.** Every seat in a wave goes out in a single message; the next wave waits. Cheap read-only lanes go first, and the seats that drive a browser or run a suite (`visual-reviewer`, `accessibility-reviewer`, `test-writer`) take a wave of their own, because each is a browser or a test runner and a wave of them is that many at once. The session's own always-loaded instructions set what a wave may cost on this machine — read them and size the wave to it.

   On `everything`, a lane is a wave's worth of work by itself: one lane per seat per wave, sliced by subsystem (`apps/api`, `packages/ui`). A seat handed a whole repo returns a survey; a seat handed a subsystem returns findings.

5. **Brief each seat.** The handoff contract's seven items are `lead` Step 3's and the report path is `gates.md`'s. Three things are this phase's own, and a seat that doesn't get them reads the wrong thing:

   - **The lane, and only the lane** — the files assigned in step 3, against the official source the seat's own definition names. A finding outside its lane is one line in its report and is not pursued, because the seat that owns those files is already in the batch.
   - **Read-only, stated.** A builder seat has write tools and a bias toward using them, so the brief names findings as the deliverable and the working tree as not to move.
   - **What the work was for.** A seat still re-derives intent from code that may have gotten it wrong, which catches *built wrong* and never *built the wrong thing*. Hand down the behaviors: the PR body on a PR target, `brief.md`'s `Done when` where the store has one, the commit messages otherwise.

   Each seat returns **its findings ranked by severity, ten at most, each with `file:line`**, plus the pointer to its report. The report on disk is uncapped and is where the passing rules, the tables and the coverage matrices go. Leave the reports closed — their existence is the record, and reading one into the main thread is the balloon waves and shortlists exist to avoid. Open one only when a returned finding is too thin to act on.

## Then fix it

6. **Merge and rank.** One list, deduplicated — two seats finding the same thing in the same file is one finding, credited to both — ranked by severity **across** seats rather than within them. Then split by `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/TRACKER.md` → **wrong → `issues/`, wanted → `TODOS.md`, unformed → `notes/`**. A look-back produces all three, and the split is what keeps this phase honest: **only the wrongs are candidates to fix now.** A want dressed as a fix is how a reflection becomes a refactor nobody scoped.

7. **Scope, slice, partition** — the three cuts, in that order, over the wrongs:

   - **Scope** — what this remediation includes. Severity ranks the list; scope draws the line across it, and everything below the line is filed, not dropped. A finding whose fix is a redesign, or whose blast radius exceeds the defect, is filed with that reason.
   - **Slice** — coherent units, each one a tracer bullet that lands on its own: a slice is something you could commit and ship by itself, not "all the auth findings." Order them by dependency, because one finding's fix is often another's precondition.
   - **Partition** — each slice to **one seat**, by the same grouping rule as step 3. A slice spanning two seats is two slices; the seat a finding was *reported* by is not always the seat that fixes it, because the file decides.

   **When the sliced work won't fit one context** — many slices, many sessions, or a dependency graph worth surviving a reset — that is `planner`'s job, not yours to improvise: `lead` Step 2.6. Point it at the filed `issues/` and let it write the plan of record; then dispatch the frontier. Below that bar, the slices live on your worklist and this step is the whole plan.

8. **Gate.** Show the user the ranked wrongs, the line you drew, and the slices in dependency order. Nothing is written to the store and nothing is dispatched before they answer, because the whole thing is a claim about work they already accepted. Their answer per line: fix it in this run, file it, or drop it. Then write what they chose, each reference anchored `file:line`.

9. **Land the slices they picked.** Dispatch each to its partitioned seat as an ordinary build — the handoff contract, the test posture, the gates it earns, the fix loop and its 2-round cap are all `lead`'s Step 3 and 4, unchanged by having come from a reflection. Two things this origin adds: each slice's brief names **the finding it closes** and the seat's report path so the builder can read the full write-up, and a fix that lands **deletes its `issues/` file** in the same change (`lead` Step 4.5).

10. **Report.** Which seats ran and in which wave, the per-seat finding counts, the line you drew and what fell below it, the slices and their seats, what landed, and what is still filed.

## Don't

- Don't fix during the look-back. A seat that edits while auditing gives you a diff and a findings list that no longer describe the same code, and phase one's `git status` check is what catches it.
