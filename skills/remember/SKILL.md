description: Capture a preference or a liked pattern into the team's cross-project inbox, to be swept back into the team later. The user-facing write half of the preference loop.

Park what the user liked into the team's preference inbox so a later `/roster learn` sweep can promote it back into the team. This is the **explicit** capture channel — the team never infers preferences from approval, so this command is how a preference gets banked. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/PREFERENCES.md` for the whole loop.

**Zero-derail.** Capture and get back to work — this is a one-line append, not a task. Do it inline; don't spawn anything.

## Do

1. **Read `$ARGUMENTS`** — the thing the user wants remembered. If empty, ask one line ("What should I bank — and is it design, code, or workflow?") and stop.
2. **Classify the lane** — `[design]` (visual/UI/motion), `[code]` (API shape, architecture, conventions), or `[workflow]` (how the user wants the team to operate). Infer from context; don't interrogate.
3. **Concrete pattern with code?** If the user is banking an actual snippet/component/layout (not just a stated preference), save the artifact to `~/.kru/patterns/<slug>.md` (kebab-case slug from the pattern) and index it with `→ patterns/<slug>.md` on the inbox line. A stated preference with no artifact is just the line.
4. **Append one line** to `~/.kru/inbox.md` (create `~/.kru/` and the file if missing), in the `PREFERENCES.md` format:

   ```markdown
   - [<lane>] <the preference, tightly worded> — _user · <project-slug> · <YYYY-MM-DD>_
   ```

   Project slug = the current repo's dir name (or `—` if none). Date = today. Source is always `user` for this command (agents append their own lines directly, per the lead's handoff).
5. **Confirm in one line** — echo the banked line, note it'll land in the team on the next `/roster learn` sweep. Then return to whatever was in flight.

## Don't

- Don't promote it now — capture is lossless and untriaged; the sweep is the gated step that edits the team.
- Don't write into the plan store (`~/.kru/management/<project-slug>/`) — that's project-specific plan state (`TRACKER.md`); preferences are cross-project and live in `inbox.md` / `patterns/` at the kru root.
- Don't dedupe or curate against existing lines — the sweep does that. Just append.
