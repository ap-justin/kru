# shared blocks — the canonical text every seat copies

`hire` copies from here; `audit` asserts against here. **This file is the source, not "the nearest peer"** — peer-copying is what produced the one real drift this file exists to prevent (three seats hired in one commit copied each other and dropped two load-bearing clauses).

Each block below has **invariant clauses** (copy verbatim — `audit` checks them) and **tailored slots** (`{…}` — fill per seat; tailoring here is correct and must not be flattened).

---

## Block A — `## Context hygiene (stay lean)`

Required on every seat that **reads or edits repo files**. The four text-producing seats (`ux-designer`, `graphic-designer`, `planner`, `conversion-copywriter`) are exempt by decision: their input is a brief handed to them, and they already carry an `## Output`/`## Handoff` contract. `ui-designer` carries it despite being an artifact seat: matching the existing app means hunting tokens, stylesheets and the closest screens across the tree, which is exactly the read this block bounds.

```
## Context hygiene (stay lean)
A {builder|specialist|reviewer} runs in its own context and can't be capped mid-run — keeping it lean is on you.
- Read only what the brief names — {the given files/ranges}, not the whole tree. If you're reading around to *find* code, stop and ask the lead for paths; broad search is `Explore`'s job, not {a builder's|yours}.
- Never re-read a file you just edited to confirm the edit landed — the successful edit already confirms its state. Measuring the finished slice is a different question.
- {the seat's docs-source bullet — the ONE reference/section to pull, never broad dumps}
- If the task really needs many files/subsystems touched, say so and let the lead slice it — don't let one run sprawl to hundreds of K tokens.

Return: {what the lead gets back — paths, commands run, what the next seat still needs}
```

**Invariant clauses** — the two marked ⚠ are the ones that drift dropped:
- `can't be capped mid-run`
- ⚠ `If you're reading around to *find* code, stop and ask the lead for paths` — this is the rule's **trigger condition**. Without it the bullet degrades to a vague "read less" and stops telling the seat *when to stop and ask*.
- `broad search is` + `` `Explore`'s job ``
- `Never re-read a file` + `already confirms its state`, plus ⚠ `to confirm the edit landed` — the **bound**. Unbounded, this bullet reads as a ban on Block O's pass and takes the return pass down with it: the seat that just edited six files is exactly the seat told never to read them again. The clause bans *verifying an edit landed*, which the harness already confirms; measuring the finished surface is the other question, and the bullet names it in its own words. It must stay self-contained: Block A binds more seats than Block O does, so a cross-reference here would dangle on every seat that carries A alone.
- `let the lead slice it`
- ⚠ `don't let one run sprawl to hundreds of K tokens` — the concrete number is what makes it bite, and it matches `lead` SKILL.md's own wording. "don't let one run sprawl" alone is not the rule.

**Tailored slots**: the seat noun, the scope nouns in bullet 1 (`the Worker + wrangler config` / `the config files + the package.jsons` / `the slow route plus its hot path`), the whole docs-source bullet, and the `Return:` line. A seat may add a bullet (the UI builders' no-mid-build-asset-fetch rule) — additions are fine, deletions are drift.

**Reviewer variant** (`code-reviewer`, `architecture-reviewer`): they never edit, so bullet 2 becomes `Never re-read a file already in context — you don't edit, so nothing you've read has changed under you.`, bullet 1 scopes to the diff, and the block opens by naming the read/change asymmetry. Their return contract is `## Output` **plus Block C.1's `## What you return`**, never a `Return:` line — this block caps what the seat *reads*, C.1 caps what it *hands back*, and the two are separate failure modes.

## Block B — `## TypeScript (shared skill)`

Required on every seat that **writes or edits TypeScript**. `python-developer` is the one code-writing seat outside it — its artifact is Python and its packaging, with no TS surface at all, so there is nothing for the block to bind; it carries Block I on its own, and the `Comments`-follows-`TypeScript` grep is unaffected because it never enters that grep's input set.

Full form (18 seats — the default for any seat writing app code; re-derive with `grep -lc 'cheat-sheet baseline' agents/*.md` rather than trusting this number):

```
## TypeScript (shared skill)
For anything TypeScript-the-language — tsconfig/strictness, module-resolution or path-alias breakage, a cryptic type error, a gnarly generic/inference or a `.d.ts`, ESM/CJS, monorepo project references, JS→TS migration, or slow type-checking — load the **`typescript`** skill (cheat-sheet baseline + type craft) and solve it in-context, not from memory. It's ambient craft in the code you're already writing, not a separate hand-off. (That skill excludes the formatter/linter + monorepo task/package graph — Biome/ESLint/Prettier, pnpm, Turborepo are the `toolchain-engineer` seat's; route that to the lead for it.)
```

**Short form** — correct when the seat only meets TypeScript at its own narrow surface. Name that surface, then the invariant tail. `cloudflare-builder` (typed `Env`/bindings, `wrangler types`), `toolchain-engineer` (+ the "you own the *task*, that skill owns the *tsconfig*" seam), `vercel-platform-engineer` (config-adjacent), `vercel-perf-optimizer` (typed `dynamic()`, `next.config.ts`), `go-fullstack-builder` (the client side of its wire — its app code is Go) all use it correctly. **These are tailoring, not drift — do not converge them onto the full form.**

Invariant in both forms: loads `` **`typescript`** `` **and** `solve it in-context`, plus a not-from-memory clause.

## Block I — `## Comments (earn the line)`

Required on every seat carrying **Block B** (23 seats — the same list, and it sits **immediately after** Block B in every one of them: both are ambient craft in the code the seat is already writing, so they read as a pair). Re-derive with `grep -L 'Comments (earn the line)' $(grep -l 'TypeScript (shared skill)' agents/*.md)` — it must return nothing.

**Exempt by decision** — record the reason, don't just omit:
- `graphic-designer` — its p5.js output comes from the `algorithmic-art` template, whose heavy instructional comments are what mark the VARIABLE sections a later run replaces. Pruning them breaks the template's own contract, and the artifact is an image, not code anyone maintains.
- reviewers and the other three text-producing seats — they write no code, so there are no comments to earn.

**The read side** — this block is what a seat writes under; `code-reviewer` → *What to hunt* is where a violation is caught. It carries the detection half as one bullet, self-contained (a reviewer writes no code, so it never loads this block): `low` for the noise a diff adds, `med` for a comment the diff **lost**, left **stale**, or **added wrong from birth** — the misdescribing half is what reaches the verdict and the fix loop. The two move together: a clause here that changes what counts as a violation needs its twin there, or the gate stops matching the rule. `lead` carries the third copy on the two paths where neither a seat under this block nor a reviewer reading for it is in the loop — the **inline** edits the lead makes itself (*Delegate on stack, not size*) and the `/code-review` fast path at Step 4. It is both halves on both.

**The audit side** — `skills/comment-fix/SKILL.md` is the third copy and the one the *user* invokes. It restates the standard rather than pointing here, for the reason `ROSTER.md` records, which makes it the copy nothing re-derives: **a class on its cut list is a class this block owes a clause**, and its `Keep, always` list is the same contract as the exemptions above. That set drifted wider once already — `lowercase`, commented-out code and `stale` were cut there with no twin here or on the gate, which is why a pass over a freshly-reviewed diff still landed hunks.

```
## Comments (earn the line)
A comment earns its line by carrying what the code can't: a constraint from outside the file, the reason a correct-looking alternative is wrong, the gotcha waiting for the next reader. Code that reads plainly gets none — a comment restating the line beneath it — or what the type checker already enforces (a literal typed to one value "must match the sdk"), or what `package.json` and the lockfile already record — is a second thing to keep true, and it goes stale first. The compiler and the manifest are the source; the comment keeps only the fact neither carries.
- **The best comment is the one the code absorbed.** Before writing one, try to move the fact into the code: a name (`isEligibleForFullBenefits()` over `// check benefits eligibility`), an extracted function, an explaining variable, a narrower type. A section banner (`// ---- helpers ----`) and a closing-brace tag (`} // end try`) mark structure an extraction's name would carry — write the extraction. Code you'd apologize for gets restructured, not annotated. And when the code can't carry the fact, write the comment — never skip both.
- **Exact, or absent.** An almost-right comment is worse than none — stale one commit early: *returns when closed* on a method that really waits a timeout and throws sends the next reader into a debugger still trusting it. And it lands whole where it stands — a hint that needs another module to decode (`// no properties file means defaults are loaded` — loaded by whom?) hands the reader the dig it existed to spare.
- **Present tense, no archeology.** The comment describes the code as it stands. What it replaced, what you tried first, what the brief said, what you just changed — git owns all of that, commented-out code included: delete it. A transition date (`became X at 2024-04-10`, `classic before 2025-09-30`) is the same once the code is past it — say what the default *is*. A reason that outlives the session (`serialized — the pool is single-writer`) is *why* and stays; the story of arriving at it goes, and so does the argument for it (`a throw here beats a cast because…`) — the reader sees the shape; they need the fact that forces it, not the alternatives weighed. A count decays the same way: `used in 11 places` is wrong at the next commit and nothing fails when it is — state a floor (`11+`) or nothing.
- **A comment documents its own line.** A note about another file's setting, a dashboard value, a webhook's api version is written for a reader who isn't here and goes stale when that other thing moves. Put it where that reader is, or in the plan store.
- **Write for the next reader of the code, not for whoever prompted you.** A summary of the work you just did belongs in your return, not in the file. So does the work you're skipping: a `TODO` is a routing decision in a comment's clothes — name it in your return and let the lead call it; a TODO in the file is never licence for the code beneath it.
- **Terse over grammatical.** One line, fragments fine, in the file's existing format. Density is the bar, not sentences.
- **Lowercase, whatever the file does.** An inline explanatory comment is lowercase even in a file full of capitalized ones — case is the one style rule the file around you doesn't set. Directives (`@ts-expect-error`, `biome-ignore`, `# noqa`), doc comments on an exported surface (JSDoc/TSDoc/docstrings), and license or `DO NOT EDIT` banners keep their own case: API, not prose.
- **Comments already in the file survive your edit.** Code you move or refactor carries its comments with it — this block governs what you write, never what's already there. An insertion between a comment and its line orphans it the same way — after every insert, the comment above the new code still describes the line beneath it. The exception is the comment your own change made **stale**: it describes behavior the code no longer has, so correct it to the truth or cut it. Stale is the bar, not chatty.
```

**Invariant clauses** — the ones marked ⚠ are what keep the block from inverting into either of its two failure modes (the write-side additions are sourced from *Clean Code* ch. 4, pp. 53–74):
- `earns its line by carrying what the code can't` + the three examples — the **positive target**. Without it the block reads as "fewer comments" and the seat prunes the useful ones alongside the noise.
- ⚠ `The best comment is the one the code absorbed` + `never skip both` — the write-time gate and the chapter's center of gravity (pp. 53–55, 67: a comment compensates for a failure to express it in code, so try the expression first). The closer is the guard: without `never skip both` the bullet reads as licence to drop the fact entirely, the exact inversion the positive target exists to prevent. Scope guard: it governs code the seat is already shaping — never a warrant to refactor standing code during a comment pass (`comment-fix` moves comment lines only, so the banner/brace-tag half is the one class where its cut and this bullet's fix differ: the skill cuts the marker, the seat writes the extraction).
- `Exact, or absent` — the born-misleading half (pp. 54, 63: an inaccurate comment is far worse than none) plus the mumble that needs another module to decode (pp. 60, 70). The **stale** exception below covers drift *after* the fact; this covers a comment wrong from its first commit — which is why the read side scores an added-wrong comment `med` alongside lost and stale, not `low` with the noise.
- ⚠ `Present tense, no archeology` — the largest single source of bloat and the fastest to go stale: the seat narrates the change it just made into the file, where git already holds it. Paired with the `is *why* and stays` clause, which is what stops the rule eating durable rationale — the reason a choice survives is exactly what no config confesses. This is the same rule `SKILL.md` applies to seat prompts; one vocabulary, two surfaces. The count corollary rides this clause rather than its own bullet — same decay, no archeology in it.
- ⚠ `Comments already in the file survive your edit` — a pruning rule reads as a licence to delete, and on brownfield that turns a hygiene block into a net loss. The bound is what the seat *writes*, never what it *finds*. The **stale** exception is the one hole in it and stays narrow by `Stale is the bar, not chatty`: unbounded, it hands back the licence the rule exists to withhold; absent, the seat is told to leave standing the comment its own edit just falsified — the line that outranks the code in the next reader's head.
- `Lowercase, whatever the file does` + the exemptions — case is the one thing the file around the seat doesn't settle, and matching the surroundings is the model's default, so without this bullet a capitalized file makes capitalized comments compliant and every one of them is a hunk the next `/comment-fix` finds. The exemptions are API: lowercasing a directive turns a tool off.
- `not for whoever prompted you` + `belongs in your return` — names the wrong audience the seat defaults to, and where that text does go. The TODO clause rides this bullet rather than its own: same wrong reader (pp. 58–59 — a TODO is not an excuse to leave bad code), and `name it in your return and let the lead call it` is deliberately Block F's escape-hatch phrasing, because a deferred piece of work is a scope call and scope calls route.
- `Terse over grammatical` + `fragments fine` — grammar is not the bar, and a seat without this clause pays for full sentences it doesn't need.

**Tailored slots**: the **surface syntax only**, and only on a seat whose language isn't JS/TS — an exhaustive list, because anything outside it is drift: the manifest named in the opener (`package.json` → `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`), the comment marker (`//` → `#`), the identifier casing in the absorbed-comment example (`isEligibleForFullBenefits()` → `is_eligible_for_full_benefits()`), the closing-brace tag where the language has no braces (`} // end try` → `# end try`), and the throw/raise keyword. Every clause, every example's *meaning*, and the bullet order are invariant — normalize those five and the text must match canonical exactly, which is the check to run rather than a visual diff (`python-developer` passes it). Two seats in the same language differing at all is drift, same as Block E.

## Block C — the return contract

Every seat ends with exactly one of:
- a trailing **`Return:`** line — builders and specialists, or
- a **`## Output`** / **`## Handoff`** section — reviewers, planners, and the asset seats, whose return is structured rather than a path list.

The two are exhaustive and disjoint, so `grep -Lc '^Return:' agents/*.md` and `grep -lE '^## (Output|Handoff)' agents/*.md` should partition the roster — re-derive rather than trusting a count here.

Pick by seat kind, not by whichever peer you opened.

### Block C.1 — `## What you return` (the five review seats)

Required on `code-reviewer`, `architecture-reviewer`, `visual-reviewer`, `accessibility-reviewer`, `ux-auditor`. It **follows** `## Output` and never replaces it: `## Output` is the **report**, this block is the **return**, and separating them is the whole point. Three of these seats say their Output is a skill's template *verbatim* — the caps here must not read as an edit to that template, or the two-callers-one-body rule forks.

Not on the builders/specialists: their `Return:` line is already a path list, which is the shape this block exists to produce. Not on the four text-producing seats: their output **is** the deliverable a next seat consumes. Not on `dispatch-auditor`: its report is the inbox lines it files — the durable artifact lives in the preference store, not in a return — and its return is a single closing line, already the shape this block exists to produce.

```
## What you return (the return is not the report)
Your context is your own; the lead's is the scarce one, and it pays for every word you hand back. {The Output above|The skill's Output} is the **report**. What you **return** is the routing payload extracted from it — the lead needs enough to route a fix, not enough to re-run your review.
- **A report path in your brief → write the full Output there, return the pointer.** No path named → return inline under the same caps.
- **Cap the inline {findings|failures|defects} at 10**, {ordering rule}, one line each: `SEV — <what>` · `file:line` · the fix in one clause. Past the cap, state what you dropped and where (`+7 low → <path>`) — a dropped finding that goes uncounted reads as a clean pass.
- **Never capped, always inline**: the verdict, the severity counts, and {the seat's coverage line}. Those are what the lead routes on.
- **Return no code.** Not the diff, not the offending lines, not your proposed replacement — the lead can open `file:line`. A fix is a clause, not a patch.
- **No narration.** {what this seat is tempted to narrate}, a restatement of your brief — none of it is a finding. Open on the first one.
```

**Invariant clauses** — the two marked ⚠ are what makes the block load-bearing rather than a politeness note:
- `the return is not the report` in the heading, and the report/return split in the opener — a seat that loses this collapses the two back together, which is the state this block was written to fix
- `A report path in your brief` + `return the pointer`, **with** the `No path named → return inline` fallback. The fallback is not optional: the lead may legitimately name no path, and a seat missing it either invents a location or returns nothing.
- ⚠ `Cap the inline ... at 10` + `state what you dropped and where` — the count is the half that bites, and **the drop notice is the half that keeps it honest**. A cap without a stated remainder is indistinguishable from a clean pass, which turns a context optimization into a silently weaker review.
- ⚠ `Never capped, always inline` + the verdict/counts/coverage triple — the cap must never reach the fields the lead routes on. Without this clause the seat caps its way past its own verdict.
- `Return no code` + `the lead can open ` + `` `file:line` `` — the single largest line item in a review return, and the one every seat reaches for by default
- `No narration` + `Open on the first one`

**Tailored slots**: the finding noun (`findings` / `failures` / `defects`), the **ordering rule** (severity for most; `systemic first` for `visual-reviewer`, **path order** for `ux-auditor` — its findings compound along the walk), the seat's coverage line (the `handed to visual-reviewer` line · the coverage line · *how it was checked* + *what wasn't verified* · where the dependency trace stopped · the resolved entry route), and what the seat narrates by habit. A seat may add a bullet for the payload *it specifically* over-returns — `visual-reviewer`'s screenshots-are-paths, `accessibility-reviewer`'s criterion tables, `ux-auditor`'s questions-and-gaps-as-counts, `code-reviewer`'s comment count (a dimension capped at `low` needs a way past a severity-ordered cap). Additions are fine, deletions are drift.

**Two documented exceptions to the caps**, both recorded rather than inferred:
- `architecture-reviewer` **design mode returns its interface spec in full** — the spec is not a finding list, it's what a builder implements, and capping it breaks the build it was dispatched to unblock. Signatures are that mode's exception to *return no code*. Review mode caps normally.
- `ux-auditor`'s **path map goes to the report, not the return** — it's the artifact that makes findings checkable, so it stays written in full, but the lead routes off defects. Its header (resolved entry route, step count, unfollowed branches) returns; the map doesn't.

**The lead's half.** A seat can only write the long half somewhere if the lead names where — `lead` SKILL.md Step 4 puts `report: ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/kru-review/<project-slug>/<seat>-<slice-slug>.md` in every review brief. That location is **deliberately ephemeral and outside the plan store**: a review is per-run and has none of the four lifetimes `TRACKER.md` defines, so nothing durable may point at it. What survives is the routed fix list and any `issues/<kebab-slug>.md` capture — never the report file.

## Block D — `## Test-first (shared skill)`

Required on every seat that implements **executable behavior with a specifiable contract** (16 seats: the four framework builders, `go-fullstack-builder`, `cloudflare-builder`, both data architects, `better-auth-specialist`, `stripe-specialist`, `paypal-specialist`, `chariot-specialist`, `nowpayments-specialist`, `quickbooks-specialist`, `web-components-builder`, `python-developer`).

**Exempt by decision** — record the reason, don't just omit:
- `react-ui-builder`, `svelte-ui-builder` — you can't go red on a layout or a motion curve; their gate is the user's visual-intent inspection. Logic-dense component internals (a reducer, validation rules) route to `test-writer` after the build.
- `web-components-builder` is the **partial**, and it's in rather than out: its element's public API (attribute→property reflection and the pre-upgrade path, emitted events and their `detail`, `ElementInternals` form value/validity, idempotent connect/disconnect) is a specifiable contract other people's pages depend on, and every one of its failures is invisible on screen — so Block D applies to it in full. What it *renders* is covered by the block's existing screen exemption, which the lead names in the brief; it needs no fourth case.
- `sanity-builder` — its primary artifact is declarative schema; TypeGen is the correctness gate on GROQ.
- `ui-designer` — its artifact is a mockup, not a running behavior: the `.dc.html` it drafts is transcribed by a builder and never ships, and the gate on it is the user's eye on the render.
- `vercel-perf-optimizer` — already carries the same discipline in a different currency: `## Prove the win` demands a measured before/after.
- `toolchain-engineer`, `vercel-platform-engineer`, `fly-platform-engineer` — config, not behavior. The Fly seat's artifact is an image plus `fly.toml`; what verifies it is a health check against a real deploy, not a red test.
- reviewers and the five text-producing seats — they don't write the code.

```
## Test-first (shared skill)
Behavior you own gets its test **before** its implementation — load the **`tdd`** skill and run its loop: one failing test → the minimal code that passes it → the next behavior. Never write the whole test file up front (the skill's horizontal-slice anti-pattern) — tests written in bulk verify *imagined* behavior and go insensitive to the real thing. Your testable surface: {the seat's behavior surface}. A **bug fix has no exemption**: the failing test that reproduces the defect lands in the same change as the fix.

Load the **`testing`** skill with it — how to find this repo's conventions before writing a line, what makes each of those tests worth keeping, and the run→fix loop (including running the suite **one-shot, never watch**: plenty of repos wire the default `test` script to interactive watch, which never exits and hangs your run with no result to report).

The behavior list comes from the **brief the lead handed you**, not from asking the user — you have no user channel, so the **`tdd`** skill's "confirm the seams under test with the user" step was the lead's grill and the seams its brief names, already done before you were spawned. If the brief doesn't settle what the contract is, test what it does say and name the assumption in your return; don't stall, and don't invent scope to test.

Three cases where you build first — do it, then **say so in the return**, naming which: **no harness exists** (nothing to go red with; standing one up is `toolchain-engineer`'s job, don't scaffold a runner mid-feature), **the shape is genuinely unknown** (a spike against an unfamiliar API — let the interface settle, then cover it before you harden it), and **the slice's deliverable is a screen** (what the user has to react to is the rendered thing and their eye is the only oracle for it, so the route/action/`load` feeding it ships with it and is covered once that intent settles). The third is the lead's call and arrives **named in your brief** — never claim it on your own.

And it does not stretch: **where the eye can't tell, there is no exemption.** The end-to-end path that connects route → data layer → render → action → write is precisely what looking at a screen cannot verify — a session that dies on redirect and a write that silently no-ops both render fine — so it goes red-green like anything else, however early it is. "It's the first version" and "tests would slow this down" are not exemptions.
```

**Invariant clauses:**
- `` load the **`tdd`** skill `` — the loop is the skill's, not restated per seat
- `one failing test` + `the minimal code that passes it` — the vertical slice; a seat that drops this reverts to test-after
- ⚠ `Never write the whole test file up front` — horizontal slicing, the longest of the three anti-patterns the vendored skill names. Without it, "test-first" degrades into batch-writing tests, which is the failure mode that produces tests nobody trusts.
- ⚠ `A **bug fix has no exemption**` — the one case with the highest value and the lowest cost (you need the repro anyway), and the one most likely to get quietly skipped under fix-it-now pressure
- `` load the **`testing`** skill with it `` — `tdd` supplies the *loop*, `testing` supplies what makes each test in it good and how to run the suite. Both, or the seat writes red-green-shaped tests against conventions it never looked up.
- ⚠ `one-shot, never watch` — the only runner *mechanics* in the block, and it earns inlining rather than living only in the skill: a watch-mode hang costs the whole run and returns nothing, so the seat can't even report what failed. Stated runner-agnostically on purpose — naming a runner would bias a seat that must defer to the repo's.
- `you have no user channel` + the brief-is-the-approval clause — this is the **adaptation** that makes a user-facing skill work inside a subagent; drop it and the seat either stalls waiting for a user or invents scope. Names `` **`tdd`** `` explicitly, not "the skill" — two skills load by this point and only one asks the user to confirm the seams first.
- both named build-first cases, and the `not one of the two` closer

**Tailored slot**: `{the seat's behavior surface}` only. Everything else is invariant — this block is short precisely so there's nothing to shorten.

**Not a substitute for `test-writer`.** This block covers first coverage of behavior the seat is building right now. What needs its own context stays `test-writer`'s (`lead` SKILL.md Step 4): coverage sweeps and fan-out across many files, repairing a red/flaky suite when no builder is in flight, and **capturing** an unfamiliar repo's conventions into a project testing doc. The seat and this block run the same `testing` skill — the split is context, not craft.

## Block F — `## Scope — build the real path, not every path`

Required on every seat that **writes app code** (19 seats: the four framework builders, `go-fullstack-builder`, `cloudflare-builder`, `sanity-builder`, both data architects, `better-auth-specialist`, `stripe-specialist`, `paypal-specialist`, `chariot-specialist`, `nowpayments-specialist`, `quickbooks-specialist`, the three UI component builders, `python-developer`). Reviewers, config seats and the four text-producing seats don't build, so there is no breadth to bound.

```
## Scope — build the real path, not every path
Pareto: traffic that exists gets built well; traffic that doesn't gets no branch. {four examples of what the seat therefore doesn't build}. Code that never executes is never known to work — it reads as coverage while being the least trustworthy code in the file.

This bounds **breadth, never rigor**{, and where the bound bites hardest on this seat: the seat's hard-rigor clause}. The paths you do build handle their real failures — an error a user can hit, a null the query can return, a request that can arrive twice. Cutting one of those is a bug, not restraint. Genuinely unsure a path carries traffic? Name it in your return and let the lead call it — don't build it speculatively, and don't silently drop it.
```

**Invariant clauses** — the two marked ⚠ are what stop the block being read as a licence to cut:
- `Pareto:` as the opener — the leading word the whole block hangs on
- `Code that never executes is never known to work` + the least-trustworthy-code clause
- ⚠ `This bounds **breadth, never rigor**` — without it a seat prunes error handling under a scope heading, which is the exact inversion this block causes when shortened
- ⚠ `Name it in your return and let the lead call it` + `don't silently drop it` — the escape hatch, and the half that keeps an unsure call from becoming a silent omission. A block with the bound and no escape hatch makes the seat decide alone.

**Tailored slots**: the four examples; the **hard-rigor clause** naming what is never marginal on this seat (`## Money rules (non-negotiable)` · `## Security (non-negotiable)` · `a constraint is not a marginal case` + `SQLITE_BUSY` · at-least-once delivery at the edge · the plan's named states on the UI builders). The data architects also swap the second sentence's closer for `an unused index is worse than dead code, since it's paid for on every write`.

## Block G — `## Build and return — no self-dispatch`

Required on the seats whose output **renders** (10 seats: the four framework builders, `go-fullstack-builder`, the three UI component builders, `cloudflare-builder`, `sanity-builder`) — the ones tempted to boot the app and look.

```
## Build and return — no self-dispatch
- Never spawn agents: no self-dispatched reviewers (visual/a11y/code), no delegated sub-builds. You build and return; dispatch and review routing is the lead's alone.
- Verify with the toolchain, not the app: {the seat's checks}. Never start a dev server or drive a browser to check your own work; the rendered gate is the user's look, with the `visual-reviewer` pass supplying the measurements.
```

**Exempt by decision** — record the reason, don't just omit:
- `vercel-perf-optimizer` — measuring a running app **is** the job; `## Prove the win` is its version of this rule.
- `toolchain-engineer`, `vercel-platform-engineer`, `fly-platform-engineer` — config; nothing renders to be tempted by.
- the data/auth/billing specialists and `python-developer` — no rendered surface, and their gate is the suite (Block D). The Python seat carries the never-boot clause anyway, tailored: an MCP server is verified by calling its tools in-process from a test, never by launching it and driving a client.
- reviewers and the four text-producing seats — they don't build.

**Invariant clauses:**
- ⚠ the never-boot clause — `drive a browser` is the string to grep (all 10 carry it, in three wordings: `Never start a dev server or drive a browser to check your own work` on six, `Never boot the app, start a dev server, or drive a browser` on the three UI builders, and `Never start a dev server, launch the Studio, or drive a browser` on `sanity-builder`, whose Studio is a second thing it would otherwise open to look). This is the load-bearing half: a seat that boots the app burns the run and still can't judge the render. The bullet's *opener* is a tailored slot, so grep this clause, never the opener.
- `the rendered gate is the user's look` — names who *does* judge it, so the ban has a positive target.
- the no-spawn bullet is cheap insurance rather than a live risk (a subagent can't spawn subagents), so it may be one line — but it stays paired with `dispatch and review routing is the lead's alone`.

**Tailored slots**: the **opener** — `Verify with the toolchain, not the app:` on the seats that have one (the framework builders, `cloudflare-builder`, `sanity-builder`), `Self-check in isolation:` on the two UI component builders, whose toolchain can't render what they wrote either — and the seat's checks (`autofixer, typecheck/build, existing tests` · `typecheck/lint` · `wrangler deploy --dry-run` + `wrangler types` · TypeGen + typecheck).

## Block H — `## Match the repo`

Required on the seats that write app code **into an existing tree** (11 seats: the four framework builders, `go-fullstack-builder`, the three UI component builders, `sanity-builder`, `vercel-perf-optimizer`, `python-developer`). The specialists that own a whole layer (data, auth, billing, platform, toolchain) carry their own brownfield rule instead — `toolchain-engineer`'s "match the repo's actual package manager" is that rule, and converging it onto this block would lose the package-manager specifics.

```
## Match the repo
Read `package.json` and {the seat's peer artifacts — existing routes / components / schema types / the hot path} first; follow the codebase's conventions ({its convention axes}) over your defaults. Minimal diff. Check `package.json` before importing anything — output the install command if a dep is missing, never assume it exists.
```

**Invariant clauses:**
- `follow the codebase's conventions` + `over your defaults` — the whole point; a seat that keeps this as "follow conventions" alone loses the tie-break rule
- ⚠ `Check `package.json` before importing anything — output the install command` — it lives **inside this block** on every seat, never under a heading of its own and never in the quality floor. One home, or it goes missing from whichever seat is written next.

**Tailored slots**: the peer artifacts and the convention axes only — plus the **manifest name** in the install-command clause where the seat's stack isn't Node (`go.mod` + `package.json` on `go-fullstack-builder`, `pyproject.toml` + the lockfile with `uv add …` on `python-developer`). The clause's shape is invariant; which file it names is not.

## Block J — the contrast clause

Required on every seat that could otherwise reach for a ratio: the three **UI component builders**, `ux-designer`, `accessibility-reviewer`, `visual-reviewer`. It rides inside whatever sentence already tells the seat where a value comes from, rather than as a bullet of its own.

```
contrast is the design's and ships as authored — no seat on this team computes a ratio
```

**Invariant clauses:**
- ⚠ `contrast is the design's` — the **positive** half, and it has to come first. Left as a bare prohibition the clause reads as a gap in the practice, and a seat helpfully fills a gap; stated as ownership it reads as a decision already taken, which is what it is.
- ⚠ `ships as authored` — this is what stops the softer failure: a seat that doesn't compute a ratio but still flags a pair as "worth checking," which routes a design decision back to the user as a defect.
- `no seat on this team computes a ratio` — team-wide, not seat-local. Scoped to the seat, each one assumes some *other* seat has it covered, and the criterion silently comes back.

**The pair carve-out — a permitted companion, never an edit to the clause.** The clause bans *deciding* a pair; it does not ban holding one together. Where the design authored a surface and its ink as one decision, a fill token spent as a text colour is a **conformance** finding — cited by token name against the system's own ledger, never by a ratio the seat worked out. The three UI builders carry it as a following sentence (*transcribing a pair includes keeping it a pair*), `ux-designer` as a clause on its critique bullet. The screen seats — `accessibility-reviewer`, `visual-reviewer` — carry **no** carve-out: for them the ban is total, because a finding they file reads as an a11y verdict whatever it cites. Recording measured ratios in a token ledger is likewise not covered by this block: that is the system documenting decisions already taken (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/ui-practice.md` → *Contrast*).

**Tailored slots**: the host sentence. `accessibility-reviewer` and the `/accessibility-review` skill additionally name **1.4.3 / 1.4.11 as unassessed** in their output, so a clean run is never read as a full-AA claim — that naming is theirs alone and is not part of this block.

## Block E — the token-vocabulary bullet

Required on the three **UI component builders** (`react-ui-builder`, `svelte-ui-builder`, `web-components-builder`) — the seats that write style values. It sits inside `## Follow the plan exactly`, under the closed-set and named-gap bullets it depends on.

**Not on the framework builders.** They mount components and write no style values, so the vocabulary is nothing they can get wrong. The **conformance gate** the builder sets up in Phase 0 is what enforces it afterwards — structural in the build where the stack allows, plus a test in the repo, and never a seat.

```
- **The token vocabulary is shadcn's semantic set** — the naming convention only: no shadcn or Tailwind dependency is implied. Read the names off the project's token file, which is the only authority — it was transcribed from what Claude Design settled, and no seat here extends it. **How a value was derived is the system's business, not yours** — a hover step may be a named `--primary-hover`, an alpha step like `bg-primary/90`, or a `color-mix()`; use whichever the file has, and return a named gap when it has none. One trap, and it arrives by pasting shadcn's own component code rather than by inventing anything: `--accent` is the **hover/selected surface**, not the brand accent (that's `--primary`) — read backwards it puts brand hue on every resting row.
```

**Invariant clauses:**
- `the naming convention only` + the no-dependency clause — without it a seat installs shadcn or reaches for Tailwind because the names implied a stack. The names are a vocabulary, not a package.
- ⚠ `Read the names off the project's token file, which is the only authority` — this is what keeps the block from becoming a **stale cache** of a list that lives in the repo being built. Enumerating the ~30 names here instead is drift: the seat opens that file anyway, and a copy goes wrong the first time the contract grows.
- ⚠ `How a value was derived is the system's business, not yours` — the team conforms to the system it was given and holds no opinion on the CSS behind it. Without this clause a seat re-derives a state step it dislikes, which is a design decision taken from Claude Design at the last possible moment, in a file nobody reviews as design.
- ⚠ the `--accent` trap. It is the block's reason to exist — the part **no token file confesses**, because it's a plausible-looking line imported from shadcn's published components rather than a value the seat invented. Read backwards it tints every resting row, and it is expensive to unpick later.

**Tailored slots**: none. The bullet is identical on all three seats by design — `audit`'s cluster check (step 6) treats any divergence between them as drift. `web-components-builder` carries **one added bullet after it**, never an edit to it: inside a shadow root distributed beyond the app the token names take a prefix, because custom properties inherit across the boundary and a generic `--primary` on a host page the team doesn't own bleeds in. An addition is fine; changing the block's own text is drift.

## Block K — `## Validation and forms (the repo's libraries)`

Required on the five **network-boundary seats** (`nextjs-builder`, `react-router-builder`, `tanstack-start-builder`, `sveltekit-builder`, `cloudflare-builder`) — the seats that own a parse boundary. One section per seat whatever the library: the library choice is a repo fact the brief carries (`references/routing.md` → *Conditional skills*), and each library's traps live in its own skill, so a new conditional skill adds a routing row and touches no seat.

```
## Validation and forms (the repo's libraries)
Before a parse boundary or a form action, load the skill for this repo's schema library and the one for its form library — the brief names them, `package.json` when it doesn't — and take the {framework} wiring from its `reference/`. Parse once at the edge and pass the parsed value inward; {the seat's edges} are that edge.
```

**Invariant clauses:**
- ⚠ `Before a parse boundary or a form action, load the skill` — the trigger leads the sentence. A library's silences (the calls that succeed and return wrong data) are the skill's to carry; a seat restating one is a cache of a file it is about to load, and the copy goes stale on the skill's schedule.
- ⚠ ``the brief names them, `package.json` when it doesn't`` — the brief is the sheet's answer; `package.json` is the environment for a direct spawn or a repo with no sheet.
- `Parse once at the edge and pass the parsed value inward` — the seat's own invariant, which no library skill states because none owns the route.

**Tailored slots**: `{framework}` in the wiring clause, and `{the seat's edges}`. `cloudflare-builder` has no form library: its heading is `## Validation at the boundary (the repo's schema library)`, the form-action trigger and the wiring clause drop, and the edge sentence reads ``Parse once in the `fetch` handler and pass the parsed value inward; bundle size decides the import on a Worker, and the skill carries the numbers.``

## Block L — the props-contract handback bullet

Required on the five **framework builders** (`react-router-builder`, `nextjs-builder`, `tanstack-start-builder`, `sveltekit-builder`, `go-fullstack-builder`) — the seats that mount components and build none. It sits inside `## The seam`, after the glue bullet that names what crosses the boundary. The bullet is the seat's half of the lead's grouping step, so it is the same sentence on every seat that fills the slot.

```
- Needed component doesn't exist yet, or one your brief names needs changing? Return its **props contract** (name, props, callbacks, loading/empty/error states) — or the delta to it — to the lead for `{ui-builder}`, and leave the file to that seat: a component path in your brief is the lead's grouping miss, handed back.
```

**Invariant clauses:**
- ⚠ `or one your brief names needs changing` + `or the delta to it` — the edit case. Without it the seat hands back only a missing component and edits an existing one in place, which is the split the seam exists to stop.
- `leave the file to that seat` — the positive half: the component file has one author.
- ⚠ `a component path in your brief is the lead's grouping miss, handed back` — the brief itself can be wrong, and the seat's answer is a return, not a build. Without it the path in the brief reads as licence.

**Tailored slots**: `{ui-builder}` only — `react-ui-builder` on the four React seats, `svelte-ui-builder` on `sveltekit-builder`. Any other divergence between the five is drift.

## Block M — the root-spacing bullet

Required on the three **UI component builders** (`react-ui-builder`, `svelte-ui-builder`, `web-components-builder`). It sits inside `## The seam`, after the bullets that say what crosses the boundary — it is the layout half of the same seam: the mount point owns where the component sits, the component owns what is inside it.

```
- **A root carries no outer spacing.** A margin on a component's root is the caller's to place, through {the passthrough}; padding is the shell's own and stays inside. A root that positions itself fits one mount point and fights every other.
```

**Invariant clauses:**
- ⚠ `A margin on a component's root is the caller's to place` — the ownership. A copy that only bans the margin leaves the seat with nowhere to put it.
- `padding is the shell's own and stays inside` — the bound: the rule is about margin, and a copy that drops this reads as "no spacing at all".
- `fits one mount point and fights every other` — the reason.

**Tailored slots**: `{the passthrough}` — ``the `className` passthrough in the props contract`` on `react-ui-builder`, ``the `class` passthrough in the props contract`` on `svelte-ui-builder`, `the host element, which the mounting page styles` on `web-components-builder`.

## Block N — `## Exhaust the {library|tool|platform|database} before you write around it`

Required on every seat that **writes code or config** (23 seats: Block F's 19 plus the four config seats — `toolchain-engineer`, `vercel-platform-engineer`, `fly-platform-engineer`, `vercel-perf-optimizer`, whose `turbo.json` / `vercel.json` / `fly.toml` / caching surfaces hand-roll the same way app code does). Reviewers and the four text-producing seats don't build.

It sits **immediately after the seat's official-source section** (`## Official source first` · `## Consult current docs` · `## Always consult the source of truth`) — it's a trigger for that same lookup, and `the source chain above` resolves only there.

```
## Exhaust the {library|tool|platform|database} before you write around it
Reaching to hand-write something — {four examples from this seat's surface} — is the cue to check whether it already ships: read its docs (the source chain above), then use what ships. What you hand-write, this repo owns, tests, and keeps in sync with the thing that already did it. Genuinely no native way? Name the gap and what you built instead in your return.
```

**Invariant clauses:**
- `before you write around it` — the heading tail, and the grep target. The heading's **noun** is a tailored slot, so grep the tail, never the whole heading.
- ⚠ `is the cue to check whether it already ships` — the **trigger**, and it has to fire at the moment of writing. The section above already says never answer an API from memory; what this block adds is a second cue for the same chain — the reach for the keyboard. Softened to a preference for libraries, it states something every seat already believes and none acts on, because the hand-roll happens mid-file where no lookup is pending.
- `use what ships` — the positive target, and the token the read side repeats.
- ⚠ `What you hand-write, this repo owns, tests, and keeps in sync` — the **price**, and the clause that flips how the hand-roll reads. Unpriced, a hand-rolled retry loop reads as diligence; priced, it reads as a second implementation of something already maintained.
- ⚠ `Name the gap and what you built instead in your return` — the escape hatch, same shape as Block F's. Without it a seat facing a real gap either stalls or hand-rolls silently, and the lead never learns the library fell short.

**Tailored slots**: the heading noun and the four examples only. The examples are what make the trigger concrete, so they name surfaces this seat meets in the file it is writing (`postgres-architect`: a constraint, a generated column, `ON CONFLICT`, a partial index) — a generic list fires on nothing.

**The read side** is one bullet in `code-reviewer` → *What to hunt*, sharing this block's `ships` token. A block with no reviewer bullet binds only the seats a build happens to route through, and nothing catches the hand-roll after it lands.

## Block O — `## The return pass`

Required on the same 23 seats as Block N — every seat that **writes code or config**. Reviewers and the five text-producing seats don't build, so there is no slice to read back; `code-reviewer` carries the **read side** instead (below).

**Exempt by decision** — record the reason, don't just omit:
- `test-writer` — its completion criterion is already hard and external (*the suite is green*), and a green suite is the one bound that resists premature completion without being asked to. It writes tests, not app code, which is also why it sits outside Blocks F and N.
- `ui-designer` — outside Blocks F and N as an artifact seat, so it inherits their boundary here. **Weakest of the exemptions**: its output is judged only by the user's eye, so it has no green to reach and the most room to stop early. Revisit if the artboard passes start coming back thin.

It sits **immediately before `## Context hygiene (stay lean)`** — the last action before the return it gates.

```
## The return pass
Believing the work is done is the cue to run this pass — that belief is what it tests. Read back every file this slice touched, together, and answer both:
- **Did I use what I had?** Every skill named above, loaded — and every pointer those skills point at, followed? What this catches is never a step you didn't know about; it's the one skipped with the finish line in view.
- **What did I leave across the whole surface?** Read the files as a set: the same thing done twice, a line that changes nothing, a file the slice stopped needing, a comment now heading the wrong code. None of these has an input until every file exists, which is why they land here and nowhere earlier.
Fix what it finds. What this slice can't absorb, name in your return rather than widening it. Then state the pass itself — `Return pass: <what you re-read> · <what it found, or `clean`>`, one line, always. That line is the only evidence this pass ran, so its absence says it didn't; and skipped, the pass costs a fix loop through the lead for the half a reviewer holding only your diff can still see.
```

**No tailored slot** — deliberately, on Block I's precedent. Both questions are seat-independent: the first is self-referential (*this* definition's skills, whatever they are) and the second names defects no stack changes the shape of. Any divergence between seats is drift, which makes the audit a plain string check.

**Invariant clauses:**
- ⚠ `Believing the work is done is the cue` — the **trigger**, and it has to fire at the moment of false completion. Every other placement fails: a pass scheduled "at the end" is one the seat believes it has already reached. Softened to *review your work before returning*, it states what every seat already believes and none does, because the belief that the work is done is what suppresses it.
- ⚠ `Every skill named above, loaded — and every pointer those skills point at, followed?` — the **process half**, and the whole reason this block isn't `code-reviewer`'s job: a reviewer reads output, and a source the seat never consulted leaves none. Everything downstream follows from that one asymmetry — the trace clause below, the read side's surface-only scope, and the ledger field the auditor files on. The tail (`never a step you didn't know about`) names the class: not a knowledge gap, a step skipped under finish-line pressure.
- `Read the files as a set` — the **cross-surface half**. Without it the pass degrades to re-reading one file at a time, which is where none of these defects is visible.
- ⚠ `name in your return rather than widening it` — the **escape hatch**, same shape as Block F's and N's, doing double duty as a scope bound: a return pass with no hatch is a licence to keep building past the slice.
- `costs a fix loop through the lead` — the **price**. Unpriced, skipping reads as momentum; priced, it reads as spending a full round-trip to have someone else find what you were holding.
- ⚠ `` `Return pass: <what you re-read> · <what it found, or `clean`>` `` + `its absence says it didn't` — the **trace**, and the clause that separates this block from a wish. Block N's hand-roll and Block F's cut path are both checkable from the diff; by the asymmetry above this one isn't, so a skipped pass and a clean pass produce identical output unless the seat says which it was. `clean` is required precisely because it is the case a seat would otherwise leave silent. The token is greppable on purpose: `hooks/log-dispatch.sh` records its presence per dispatch, which is what lets `dispatch-auditor` see a pass that never ran.

**The read side** is one bullet in `code-reviewer` → *What to hunt*, sharing this block's `across the slice` token. Surface half only, per the asymmetry above.

## Block P — the unreachable-source clause

Required on every seat whose source chain **leads with an MCP server or a plugin**: `better-auth-specialist`, `cloudflare-builder`, `fly-platform-engineer`, `nextjs-builder`, `sanity-builder`, `svelte-ui-builder`, `sveltekit-builder`, `vercel-perf-optimizer`, `vercel-platform-engineer` — plus the seats naming an MCP tool in their own frontmatter, where an absent server leaves a dead entry rather than a slower path: `architecture-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `graphic-designer` (`mcp__context7__*`), `accessibility-reviewer`, `visual-reviewer` (`mcp__chrome-devtools__*`). It rides inside the seat's official-source section, after the chain it qualifies.

**Exempt by decision** — `planner` holds `mcp__context7__*` in its tool list and names no source chain in its body, so the clause would have nothing to qualify and would be writing that seat a chain it doesn't have. Its dead tool entry is real and it is a `planner` gap, not this block's: fix it by giving the seat a source chain, and the block follows.

```
**A source you can't reach is one you say is missing.** MCP servers and plugins are enabled per project, so the server above may not be connected in this repo — check before working from the next rung down. Missing, your first line names it and the command that enables it, and then you either work the fallback with every claim it produced marked unverified, or hand the question back. Silently taking the lesser path returns work that reads as sourced and isn't.
```

**Invariant clauses:**
- ⚠ `enabled per project` — the **mechanism**, and the reason the seat has to look. A seat that has used a server in one repo carries no evidence about this one, and the absence presents as an ordinary empty tool list rather than as an error.
- ⚠ `your first line names it and the command that enables it` — the **trace**, and the half that makes the clause actionable rather than a disclaimer. A seat reporting the gap at the end reports it after spending the run on the fallback; named first, the lead can enable the server and re-dispatch for the price of one message. The command is required because the lead is the one who runs it and the seat is the one that knows which server it wanted.
- ⚠ `marked unverified` — what keeps the fallback honest. Training data answers every question the MCP would have, in the same voice, which is exactly why a fallback the return doesn't label is indistinguishable downstream from a sourced answer.
- `hand the question back` — the second branch, and it has to stay available: where the chain has no rung under the missing one, working on is guessing.

**Tailored slots**: the server's name where the seat's chain names exactly one (`the server above` otherwise), and the host sentence it attaches to. Three seats already carry a fallback instruction of their own — `better-auth-specialist`, `sveltekit-builder`, `svelte-ui-builder` — and the clause **replaces** it rather than sitting beside it; two copies of a fallback rule are the drift this block exists to close.
