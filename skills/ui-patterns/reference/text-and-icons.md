# Text and icons

## An icon beside a label aligns to the label's first line

**Trigger:** an icon, bullet, avatar or status dot set beside text that can wrap to two or more lines.
**Pattern:** give the icon a box exactly one line tall and align it to the start of the text.
**Default it corrects:** centering the icon against the whole text block, so it drifts to the middle of a two-line label and lands between the lines on three — or pinning it with a hand-tuned `margin-top` that is correct at exactly one font size.
**Why:** the reader's eye enters at the first line; the icon labels that entry point, not the paragraph's geometric center. A magic-number offset also silently breaks the moment the type scale, the line-height, or the user's zoom changes.
**Shape:**
```css
.icon { block-size: 1lh; align-self: start; }  /* one line tall, so it centers on the first line */
```
**Applies when:** the text can wrap. A single-line label that cannot wrap centers fine either way — reach for this when the string is user-supplied or the container is narrow. `lh` units carry a Baseline status; `modern-css` owns whether this stack needs a fallback. **Where the mark is also a tap target**, the one-line box is the *layout* box and the target grows around it — padding, or an overlay pseudo-element — so the alignment above still holds. A 44px layout box measures more than one line, and `align-self: start` only moves whichever box is shorter than the row: inert while the label is single-line, and moving the *label* instead once it wraps past 44px. Measure both boxes before accepting a one-line alignment fix.

## An icon-only control leaves the row's baseline group

**Trigger:** an icon-only button — copy, edit, remove, a disclosure caret — in a row aligned on `align-items: baseline` beside text.
**Pattern:** take the control out of the baseline group and centre it on the row's first line, where the mark beside wrappable text already sits (entry above).
**Default it corrects:** leaving it in the group as one more baseline-aligned item, which looks right until the control's box is taller than the text's.
**Why:** a control with no text in it has no real baseline, so it synthesises one at its own bottom margin edge. The row then aligns the *label's* baseline to the bottom of the button and drags the text down by the button's padding. Nothing overflows and nothing errors — the text just sits low, and the `margin-top` that appears to fix it is correct at exactly one control size.
**Applies when:** the row is baseline-aligned and the control has no text child. A control with a visible label has a baseline of its own and belongs in the group.

## Explanatory prose enters on request, and the request is a defect report

**Trigger:** about to write helper text under a control, a sentence introducing a section, a caption beside an image, or an explanatory line at the top of a screen — or handed a request to add one.
**Pattern:** ship the screen without it. When prose is asked for, read the ask as a report that the control, its label, or the step order is unreadable — fix that, and write the line only where the words themselves were what was wanted.
**Default it corrects:** deciding on your own that the screen needs explaining — "Use the form below to update your profile" above a profile form, "Enter your email address" under a field labeled Email, a caption naming what the picture plainly shows — and then, once someone does ask for a line, pasting the sentence in and shipping, leaving the control that earned the ask exactly as it was.
**Why:** every redundant line is one more thing between the reader and the control they came for, and each one costs the *next* line credibility: prose that has been useless three times gets skipped on the fourth, including the time it mattered. That skip rate is also why the requested sentence is the wrong fix alone — the line reaches the few who read prose, while the unreadable label meets everyone. It's a second thing to keep true when the UI changes, too.
**The test before the register:** does the reader do anything differently for having read it? A true sentence in the right vocabulary still fails it if they'd press the same press either way — "18 lines in that range" fails, so would "18 gifts". Four always fail: a message confirming things are fine (working is the silent default; the control appearing is the feedback), a figure the reader can't check against anything they know, a warning aimed at someone other than the reader, and how the data got here ("updated by the import", "moves weekly"). What the reader already knows depends on who reads the screen: a practitioner's screen skips their own jargon and process, while a screen a newcomer or outsider reads explains both, because neither the UI nor their job says it for them. Before a sentence, reach for a mark — a count, a state mark, a rule — and keep the sentence only where no mark can carry it.
**Applies when:** always, for prose explaining the interface. Empty states, errors and confirmations are the opposite case — they say what happened and what to do next, because there is no UI demonstrating it. An empty state says what to do; a paragraph on what the section is for is the standfirst with fewer rows. Prose survives only for what the UI cannot show: a consequence in a confirm, a refusal, an errand elsewhere. A constraint the control genuinely can't express — a format, a limit, what happens after the button — is not a licence to write it unasked: build the control so it carries the constraint, and where nothing can, name the gap in your return.

## Copy states what the system guarantees, not the outcome downstream of it

**Trigger:** a line of copy claiming something about a number the product controls only one side of — a fee, a payout, a delivery date, a refund, a rate.
**Pattern:** state the side the rule actually fixes. Where the rule sets what the user is charged, say what they pay; say what someone else receives only where nothing between here and there can change it.
**Default it corrects:** promoting the rule into the outcome the reader cares about — "100% reaches the recipient" from a rule that only sets the sender's fee, so any cost further down the chain makes the sentence false.
**Why:** it's a promise the code cannot keep, and unlike a wrong label it is not wrong *on the screen where it's written* — it fails later, elsewhere, to someone counting the difference. Nothing on this screen can catch it, so the check happens as the line is written or not at all.
**Applies when:** money, time and quantity claims. A claim wholly inside the system's own control — "your changes are saved" — is not this.

## A stored display name sits after a fixed phrase

**Trigger:** attribution copy rendering a name the system stored — "set by", "edited by", an activity row, a byline.
**Pattern:** park the name after a phrase the product owns: `set by {name}`, `removed by {name}`, `worked on by {name}`.
**Default it corrects:** `{name} removed this` at the head of a sentence, or `{name}'s changes` — both assuming the stored string is capitalised and grammatically a person's name.
**Why:** display names are not reliably capitalised (an account seeded from a credentials file stores the lower-cased username), and capitalising one at render is a different bug — it rewrites someone's name. The English possessive fails on a name already ending in *s*, and on anything that is not a person. Neither breaks on the screen where it is written; both break on one user's row, in production.
**Applies when:** the name is user- or system-supplied. A literal the product controls is prose and reads normally.

## A section's status word reads standalone

**Trigger:** a per-section state summary in a settings or setup screen — one word per section, scanned down a column.
**Pattern:** pick words that parse alone — **Configured** / **Incomplete** — and spell the incomplete state the same way in every section. A section that cannot determine its own status reports one page-level failure, said once, in the shape the app already uses for a lost connection.
**Default it corrects:** relative words that only parse while reading the whole ledger top to bottom ("Ready", "Not yet", "None yet"), spelled differently per section — and the incomplete word doubling as the state a failed status fetch falls back to.
**Why:** per-section spellings read as variety to the author and as inconsistency to everyone else. The fallback is the expensive half: telling an operator their working setup is unconfigured sends them to fix something that is not broken, and a status word that can lie about a working system is worth less than no status word.
**Applies when:** several sections report status side by side. A lone status word has no column to be inconsistent with.

## A qualifier on a variable-length label leads it

**Trigger:** a status word attached to a stored name — retired, no longer offered, archived, draft — rendered where the label can be cut: an `<option>`, a cell with `text-overflow: ellipsis`, a chip.
**Pattern:** the qualifier goes first: `No longer offered: <name>`.
**Default it corrects:** `<name> (no longer offered)`, the qualifier trailing the name.
**Why:** truncation cuts the tail, and it cuts the qualifier off exactly the rows where it matters — the long names. A native `<option>` ellipsises at the control's width and the platform decides where; leading, the qualifier survives any cut and the list scans by state.
**Applies when:** the label's length is not the product's to control. A fixed literal never truncates.

## A heading's box is its own line, never a target's floor

**Trigger:** a control set beside a heading — an edit press next to a section title, a close button on a card's title row.
**Pattern:** size the heading's box to its own text; the control beside it takes its hit area from its own padding, hanging past the line with a negative margin or an overlay pseudo-element.
**Default it corrects:** stretching the heading's row to the control's target height, so every heading with a button beside it grows to the target minimum — or trimming the control's target to the line to keep the row tight.
**Why:** the type scale set the heading's line and a target minimum was never a typographic decision; padding the row breaks the vertical rhythm for a sibling's sake, while trimming the control breaks the target. A target that overhangs the line keeps both. The measured size is `accessibility-reviewer`'s.
**Applies when:** the control's target is taller than the heading's line box. Equal heights need nothing.

## An icon is drawn from the icon set, never typed as a character

**Trigger:** an arrow, check, crown, chevron or any glyph standing beside or inside a label.
**Pattern:** use the repo's icon set, `aria-hidden` beside a label. A brand's mark (GitHub, Google, Facebook) is the brand's own official SVG, pre-sourced like any asset.
**Default it corrects:** `→`, `↓`, `✓` or an emoji typed into the string, or a generic icon set's lookalike of a brand's logo.
**Why:** a character draws in whatever font the platform falls back to, so its size, weight and baseline differ per OS, and a screen reader reads it aloud ("rightwards arrow", "crown"). A lookalike brand mark is the wrong mark, and most brands' guidelines forbid it.

## A figure's scope rides in its label

**Trigger:** a value with a caveat or a fixed period — "rolling 12 months", "excludes refunds", a monthly figure from outside the app — shown beside values that follow a toggle or share a card.
**Pattern:** put the scope in the value's own label ("Revenue, rolling 12 mo"). Values that can't follow a period toggle sit in their own labelled row, and only values that sum over the period change when it's toggled.
**Default it corrects:** a sentence under the figures explaining which ones are different, or a period toggle that silently swaps a figure it can't recompute.
**Why:** the label is read with the number every time; a note is read once, if at all, and the number is later quoted without it. A figure that ignores the toggle while its neighbours follow it reads as a figure that changed.

## A screen whose breadcrumb ends in its own name draws no second heading

**Trigger:** a page heading on a screen with a breadcrumb trail, or on the app's home route.
**Pattern:** let the last crumb (`aria-current="page"`) name the screen and draw no visible heading repeating it; keep the standfirst. Home draws no visible title either. The document still gets its `<h1>` — make the heading visually hidden rather than dropping it.
**Default it corrects:** `Home › Donations › Donations` — an `<h1>` one line below the crumb that already says it, or "Home" or "Dashboard" as the title of the page someone just landed on.
**Why:** the reader has already read the name once; a second copy pushes the content down and teaches the eye to skip the top of the screen. Screen-reader users navigate by heading, so the `<h1>` stays in the markup.

## A 44px target inside a line of text keeps the line its own height

**Trigger:** a link or press inside running text or a label/value line that needs the target minimum.
**Pattern:** extend the hit area with padding plus an equal negative block margin, so the line box stays the text's height. Where two such targets can land on adjacent lines of one wrapped sentence, the sentence's `line-height` is at least the target height. The control and the value it acts on are one `white-space: nowrap` unit.
**Default it corrects:** `min-height: 44px` on the inline control, which pushes its line apart from the rest of the paragraph — or keeping the line tight and letting two targets' hit areas overlap across lines, or a line break that orphans "Change" at the head of the next line.
**Why:** a target taller than its line either breaks the paragraph's rhythm or overlaps its neighbour's target, so a tap lands on the wrong one; an orphaned control reads as belonging to whatever follows it. The measured size is `accessibility-reviewer`'s.
**Shape:**
```css
.inline-press { padding-block: var(--target-pad); margin-block: calc(-1 * var(--target-pad)); }
.press-with-value { white-space: nowrap; }
```

## A QR code's quiet zone is part of the drawing

**Trigger:** rendering a QR code, and placing anything next to it.
**Pattern:** draw the code with its quiet zone inside a symmetric viewBox and no frame — no border, no ground box, no extra padding. Nothing sits inside the quiet zone, and gaps to neighbours are measured in rendered pixels from the nearest module, not from the element's box.
**Default it corrects:** a bordered or padded card around the code, a caption placed at the box's edge (visually inside the quiet zone), or a viewBox cropped on one side so the space above and below differs.
**Why:** scanners need the quiet zone (ISO/IEC 18004: four modules), and the eye reads it as space too, so a caption the CSS puts at 8px sits much farther from the ink than from what's above it, and proximity groups it with the wrong thing. The zone is symmetric by construction, so unequal space above and below always comes from the viewBox.
